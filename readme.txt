WordPress PHP Console powered by PsySH

== Description ==
WP Console brings the famous PsySH on your browser. PsySH is a runtime developer console, interactive debugger and REPL for PHP.

Write your code in code editor, press `Shift+Enter` and get your output in your browser.

You can also use PsySH with wp-cli with the command `wp shell`. wp-cli has built-in support for psysh already. You need to just active WP Console to use this.

WP Console requires WordPress v5.0 or later.

Please note that, currently PsySH commands like `ls`, `doc`, `show` etc and Magic variables like `$_`, `$__class` etc are not supported in browser console.
